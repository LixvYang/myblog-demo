But, one little thing is different from before. When 2 hours later, course is coming to an end. My linear algebra teacher liu ,he accidentally walked to my side, ask me : Why don&#39;t you play games like them?Really like reading? He watched the title of my book, and keep asking me what have you learnt from this book?</p><p>I thought for a while and spoke slowly, the black swan refers to the unpredictable major events, Unpredictable refer the reason for this incident is always summed up after the fact, and here is the problem. The black swan is always impossible to predict. Later, I gave a lot of interesting examples, some in this book, some in real world. And yesterday I read the whole skin in the game which is the other book published with Taleb. Thanks Taleb. I persuaded the teacher. And then he say : <strong>&quot;What you do is more valuable than linear algebra&quot;</strong>.</p><p>Although the books of Taleb are very hard to understand. It requires extraordinary comprehension and strong reading ability. Even a few days before I finished buying the book, I didnâ€™t have the courage to open the book.</p><blockquote><p>Courage is the only virtue that cannot be forged. -Taleb</p></blockquote><p>But if you can understand his methods. You will be moved to tears. Rare wise man in the world.</p><hr><p>This week, I have wasted at least 10 hours, my phone is broken, so I decide to buy a new phone for rest of my college time.Most of the time, I want to buy IPhone12 that price is 4999RMB in Pinduoduo. But I can&#39;t, because of I don&#39;t have enough cash.Although I am rich, but the most of my wealth is Cryptocurrency. In the next three months, BTC will be a new high, so I can&#39;t sell my btc to buy a phone.</p><p>Yes, this is where I struggle, I don&#39;t have enough money, but I want to buy a good phone...In desperation, spent at least ten hours.</p><p>In the end, at this night, I went out and repaired my old phone and it only cost me 10 dollars. <em>Although I reconnected with the world, but who can make up for the ten hours I wasted?</em></p><p>Ten hours,I can reread Taleb&#39;s book,or learn deep architecture.I am very regretful for the ten hours spent in anxiety and helplessness. Although this problem can be solved with money, a total of similar problems in the world that cannot be solved with money, <strong>choose</strong>.Choice anxiety.</p><p>What I can do is to choose what meets my values as much as possible, instead of thinking about the problem with entanglement, thanks for reading.</p>',12),h=[r];function s(i,l){return t(),a("div",null,h)}const c=e(n,[["render",s],["__file","More-valuable-than-linear-algebra.html.vue"]]);export{c as default};
