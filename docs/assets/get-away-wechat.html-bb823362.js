I have been thinking about this issue. Obviously, the backend of WeChat can monitor everyone&#39;s chat data, whether it is a transfer function or a normal chat. So how serious is this problem? I think there may be the following:</p><ol><li>Violation of human rights</li><li>Annihilation of innovation</li></ol><p>Let me talk about the first point of human rights. In Wikipedia, natural human rights refer to inalienable rights, which are universally inherent powers of creatures in nature. What does that mean?</p><p>That is, a person is born with a mouth, which means that he is free to eat and talk with his mouth. But the current society is self-evident. There are some things that can’t be said, even if the correct opinion is accused of unnecessarily, it is hard to escape the blame.</p><p>So let’s talk about the second point, annihilating innovation. The privacy problem actually rises to a certain extent and it becomes the overall problem of society. But how does this social problem involve innovation?</p><p>You might as well imagine this. When you turn on your phone and open the green WeChat, you want to see the current life of your friends in your Moments, but there are countless advertisements when you flip through it, but by coincidence, these advertisements happen to be there. The things you want, these things you can block once or twice, and you can ignore them once or twice, but every time you feel violated.</p><p>Of course, as an adult, you may ignore these annoying advertisements, but the question is, can the younger generation escape?</p><p>A person has been living in such an environment when he was a teenager, so data can only guide his values, <strong>because I live in the virtual world of the Internet every day almost more than in the real world</strong> . In addition, teenagers do not have complete thinking skills. I still remember that when I was in my second grade, I could use my mobile phone to log in to Taobao and use the operation of refreshing products every day.....so</p><p>**Maybe everyone think about it, what determines that some people have reached the top of the pyramid, and some people can only live a life beyond making ends meet with a salary day after day. **</p><p>The answer to this question is really that 99% of successful people are diligent and 1% of genius?</p><p>Even in the best schools, most people still live their lives in mediocrity.</p><p>My thinking is that in this era, computers can replace most of human work, and as time grows, this proportion will increase. Computers can read past data. From this point of view, whether it is mental work or a craftsman, it is not as sophisticated as a machine. So what is the remaining value that makes people human?</p><p>**Those unknown secrets, the roads you have traveled, the people you have met, and the things you have experienced constitute a person&#39;s core value in this era. **</p><p><strong>People who value privacy are more likely to have independent thinking skills</strong>.</p><p>But most people will not think about this anymore. When privacy is uploaded, it means that creativity and reflection are deprived in the data age. Of course, the most important thing is that if you pay attention to privacy protection for a long time, then you are most likely to have independent thinking ability to reflect on whether these things are right or wrong now? Is it a long-term or a bubble?</p><p>So here comes the problem. Although I use WeChat for less than half an hour a day, its user base is too large, as large as in China. You don’t need WeChat, you can’t even go out because you need a health code.</p><p>There are also some passive reasons. Because everyone around us uses WeChat, there is another reason why we have to use it: **It&#39;s not that you can&#39;t use **.</p><p>Later, Dong Ge&#39;s words in the group awakened the dreamer:</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>Do not always think selfishly about what you are doing. The efforts of a few people protect others.

Most people just want to see the inconvenience when doing things, without considering the long-term consequences. But the progress of mankind, and even the protection of basic human rights, always requires someone to think about the appropriateness of things.

Many people don’t realize that if you lose your privacy, you lose freedom. Without freedom, you are a slave. The progress of society is reflected in the change in the ideology of slaves, but the constant is that if you don’t fight, it’s possible. Become a slave.

There are always excuses. For example, they are not unusable.

When future generations begin to be enslaved and controlled by these big companies, I hope that this process does not have your contribution

In fact, you can choose Alipay for this matter, but when I choose to delete WeChat, I also choose to delete Alipay. Although Tencent is not a good fruit, Alibaba is not much better (of course, you can&#39;t blame them, this problem May wish to discuss it here). So I found the cloud flash payment software, the payment method can still survive on campus-------</p><p>Chat software, this can actually choose a freshman university, but QQ cannot be uninstalled, because the notifications in the school are notified through QQ. Fill out a form and ask for a leave. You must use QQ. This is a problem that cannot be solved. .....</p><p>So far, the most critical issue has been resolved. Of course, the most critical issue is how my family can contact me. Next time I go home, I may need to teach them how to use the freshman university software, or directly build one in Quorum. Groups, but for the time being, when talking with mother, you can only choose manual call.</p><p>Delete...</p><h2 id="results-after-leaving" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#results-after-leaving" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Results after leaving</h2><p>Things are simpler than I thought, but just press and hold the APP, and then click Uninstall and it&#39;s over. So within a few days, I picked up the phone and remembered that there was no WeChat in the phone. What&#39;s so interesting? So save a lot of time to do more meaningful things. For example, it took five hours to re-read &quot;Silly Decameron&quot; and &quot;Shanghai Jiaotong University Survival Manual&quot;. Technical books include most of the contents of &quot;MySQL Must Know and Know&quot; and &quot;Go Programming Practice&quot;, which is more every day. A lot of time to write code.</p><p>Although I have been studying in the library and writing code almost every day during the year of college, my feelings are always different these days. Perhaps I declare to the world in my heart: <strong>I am not a slave, I have to struggle</strong>.</p><p>Many people in the system have to read about the youth study about patriotism and love for the party. For school students, it is the &quot;Youth Study&quot;, which must be handed in every week, whether it is at school or on vacation, which is beyond my understanding. ** After all, this is not North Korea.</p><p>If the people behind it have read &quot;Anti-fragility&quot;, they will know the anti-fragility of information. Those who can&#39;t kill me will make me stronger. But I am still patriotic, I still have someone I love, and the things I love live on the land, my ancestors for generations...</p><p>The result is that I don’t need to watch &quot;Youth Learning&quot; because how can I watch it without WeChat? Am I right?</p><h2 id="but-in-the-end-i-returned-to-wechat" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#but-in-the-end-i-returned-to-wechat" aria-hidden="true">#</a> But in the end I returned to WeChat</h2><p>Although it is not a necessary option, I still have to return to WeChat, because almost everyone is using WeChat and people are social creatures.</p><p>You still have to pay for the Youth University Study. Although you haven&#39;t done it for a few days, someone is always urging you-it&#39;s not unavailable.</p><p>I saw a girl on campus and wanted a contact information, almost only through WeChat</p><p>If I want to go out of school and go shopping in the mall, it seems that the health code can only be used on WeChat</p><p>Geek time, the courses that are subscribed inside, seem to be WeChat</p><p>WeChat has become the entire Internet...</p><p>Forced to return</p><p>I hope it will last more than three days next time</p><h2 id="a-few-suggestions-for-friends-who-want-to-leave-the-wechat-circle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#a-few-suggestions-for-friends-who-want-to-leave-the-wechat-circle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> A few suggestions for friends who want to leave the WeChat circle</h2><ol><li>Means of payment</li><li>Social issues</li><li>Passive issues</li><li>......</li></ol><p>Each of these problems is different for everyone, and because I am only a student, my solution is also different from that of many people. Everyone needs their own way of solving this problem, and this matter can almost only be solved by oneself.</p><p>No way, who makes us not want to be slaves?</p><p><strong>Who are we</strong>?</p><h2 id="chinese-version" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#chinese-version" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Chinese version</h2><p>三天前换了新手机，看到Mixin群里有几位朋友聊天，聊到了微信的隐私问题和大企业的数据垄断问题。我其实也一直在想这个问题，很明显微信的后台是可以监视每个人的聊天数据，不论是转账功能，还是普通的聊天，那么这件事情的问题有多么严重呢？我想可能有以下几点：</p><ol><li>践踏人权</li><li>湮灭创新</li></ol><p>先说说第一点人权，天赋人权在维基百科上指不可剥夺的权利，是自然界生物普遍固有的权力。什么意思呢？</p><p>即一个人生出来就有嘴，就意味着他是可以自由用嘴去吃饭，用嘴去说话的。但当下的社会却不言而喻了。有些话是不能说的，即使是正确的意见被冠上莫须有的罪名，也是难逃其咎的。</p><p>那么说说第二点，湮灭创新，隐私问题其实上升到一定程度上就到了社会的整体问题，但这个社会问题又怎样涉及到创新呢？</p><p>不妨这样假象一下，当你打开手机，打开绿色的微信，想看一看朋友圈里朋友的生活近况，但翻着翻着就有了无数的广告，但好巧不巧，这些广告就正好有你想要的东西，这些东西你可以屏蔽一次两次，可以置之不理一次两次，但每次都感觉收到了侵犯。</p><p>当然作为成年人，你可能会忽略掉这些烦人的广告，但问题就在于年轻的下一代能逃过去吗？</p><p>一个人在十几岁时就一直生活在这样的环境氛围中，那么引导他价值观的就只能是数据了，<strong>因为每天活在网络虚拟世界里的时间几乎比现实世界里更多</strong>。而又，十几岁的人其实是不具备完整的思考能力的，我还记得我初二时，可以用手机登录淘宝时，每天日度一日地刷商品这样的操作.....所以</p><p><strong>不妨大家想一想，究竟是什么决定了有的人走到了金字塔的顶端，有的人只能日复一日领着薪水过着入不敷出的生活。</strong></p><p>这个问题的答案真的是成功的人有百分之九十九的勤奋，和百分之一的天才？</p><p>即使是在最好的学校里，仍然有绝大部分人庸庸碌碌过完一生。</p><p>我的思考是，在这个时代里，计算机能替代人的绝大部分人类的工作，而且随着时间的增长，这个比例会越来越大。计算机可以读取以往数据，以此来看，不论是脑力工作，还是手工匠人，都不及机器来的精巧。那么人之所以为人所剩下的价值究竟是什么呢？</p><p><strong>那些不为人知的秘密，曾经走过的路，遇到的人，经历过的事构成了一个人在这个时代里最核心的价值。</strong></p><p><strong>注重隐私的人，更有有可能具备独立思考能力</strong>。</p><p>但绝大部分人不会去思考这些了，隐私被上传，就意味着在数据时代被剥夺了创造性和反思能力。当然最关键的是，如果你长期注重于隐私保护，那么你就极有可能拥有独立思考能力，去反思这些事情放到现在而言究竟是对还是错？究竟是长期还是泡沫？</p><p>那么问题来了，虽然我每天使用微信的时间不及半个小时，但它的用户基础太过于庞大，庞大到在中国。你不用微信，你连出门都出不得——因为要健康码。</p><p>还有一些被动原因，因为身边所有人都用微信，所以不得不使用的原因还有一个就是：<strong>又不是不能用</strong>。</p><p>后来东哥在群里的几句话，点醒了梦中人啊：</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>做事情不要总自私的想自己怎样怎么样，少数人的努力保护了其他人。

大部分人做事时只想看方不方便，不考虑长期后果。但人类的进步，甚至人类基本权利的保障，总需要有人做事情时想想合不合适。

很多人没有意识到，你失去了隐私，就失去了自由，没有自由就是奴隶，社会的进步就体现在，奴隶的意识形态也发生了变化，但不变的地方是如果你不抗争，就可能变成奴隶。
