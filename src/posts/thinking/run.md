# For the long run

This morning, I ran a kilometer and used 4 minutes. Okay, so did the results a year ago. But the important thing I want to say is FOR THE LONG RUN. In the past year, I often started running at 6 o'clock in the morning, and occasionally took a walk. The fresh air in the morning always made me happy. My school playground always great, yes, at least now. 

Usually,this time is all Chinese college students to exercise, So did I.When I finished the challenge, its feel was amazing. Accompanied by severe physical pain, my respiratory tract was very painful. The cold air ravaged my body. But I still recovered very quickly, and had breakfast. The coffee after breakfast gave me a little comfort and made me feel that the world is still very beautiful.

Haha,it is now three days later, 2021.10.18.

Today I wrote a whole day of code. I was lazy two days ago which my RedmiK30 phone was broken, and I decided to change to a better phone such as IPHONE at 11.11.2021 Singles Day.
