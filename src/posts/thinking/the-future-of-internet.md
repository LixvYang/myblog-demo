# The future of the internet

Well know, electronic identities have become popular in recently years,which make our personal information public in internet. Worse,internet company collect our personal privacy information sell to information vendors to make money,which make us become transparent in the world.

These days now, every morning, I have to hang up Ads's call from my phone,with they alway recommended to me some meaningless things,as house,cars,loan...But I have told them many times that I don't need these.Oh shit,they persevere.I thought,if they have this feature apply to other places,which could make them success.:(

One day,my Zhihu personal communication receive me a message to the effect that the masses of people need apps that can chat normally without ads and information collection. Yes,I spot this.Our current needs are the future of security and privacy.

> Human revolutionize successfully and totally from bottom to high only when their basic living conditions are destroyed and their lives are threatened seriously.At most time,people fix things,they fix things for  higher  profit and stronger monopoly.

Only when our own tangible interests are harmed can we be unilted.

When I was taking a marketing course, my teacher told me that in past few yeaes, the advertising time has  become so lang that members who do not not recharge can not watch the video. 

I very much agree.

Although,I have not the habit of watching movies and TV shows. But when I want watch TV,I have to waiting a mintue-long shit ad.Very poor user experience.

Another thing I meet in recent is that I want to resgiter a public account to use foreign product, when I got the SMS code, the pervasive advertising send me a waring.

I did nothing, I got a waring.How nosense.

After this incident, the most fearful place is that my phone has been monitored. Actually,I am a person who abide by the law,don't need to be nonitored,but they do. Wait a moment. They? Who? Policymakers.

I want to buy a coffee that can make me pleasure. But the first thing when the idea appear in my brain is pick up my phone that can help me to order a coffee from wechat,Meituan,Eleme and so on.So I give up , I want to go downstairs to continue my journey, but my way is halfway , I think I have to open my transaction code to submit orders. This journey is back to beginning. When I submit my orders I reveal my IP address and my personal information that included my ID , phone number, even my height weight and health information and so on.

I want to logout my taobao account since all my express delivery from business to cainiao a App recorded everyone's safe and private information. Surprisely, I found I have delivery on the way. I must wait for all the stuff on my hand. But I find the most funny thing that I have to buy the new things to enrich my life , it is so funny that I can't solve this problem. Even though I know all my information will be collect to enterprise database. But I can not leave it.
